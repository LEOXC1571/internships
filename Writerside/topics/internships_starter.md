## Zhejiang Lab, 2022.07-2023.08
I was an intern at research center for graph computing Zhejiang Lab, under the advisement of [Dr. Hongyang Chen](https://en.zhejianglab.com/institutescenters/Faculty/202112/t20211206_2904.shtml).

During my interships, I worked closely with [Jinsong Lv](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jingsong-lv-9201776b/), [Hu 
Chen](https://github.com/Tigerrr07), Feng An, Shiming Zhang, and [Haosen Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=epuCzU0AAAAJ).

During my intership, I worked on OGB-LSC @NeurIPS 2022 PCQM4M-v2 track and got 11th place globally. I also did some 
research on molecule pretraining, 3D molecule generation and diffusion based graph generative methods. With any luck.
publications will be out soon.
